# Imageclassification
Image Classification Using CNN in Keras This project showcases an end-to-end pipeline for classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras. The model is trained on a custom dataset provided in CSV format, where each row contains pixel data representing an image and its associated label.
